# self_driving_car
This is your own self driving car where your own Tesla can go left, right, and forward with just 60 lines of python your self driving car will be up and running.
I have done it by using Pycharm which is an python code editor.
For the code I have used a pip (python installation package) which is **pip install pygame**.
I have installed the same both packages in the terminal.
After installing the packages in the terminal you have to download some images which I will give in different files.
